            If you dishonestly enter information or make a statement that you know
            is, or might be, untrue or misleading, and intend by doing so to make
            a gain for yourself or another person, or to cause loss or the risk of
            loss to another person, you may commit the offence of fraud under
            section 1 of the Fraud Act 2006, the maximum penalty for which is 10
            yearsâ€™ imprisonment or an unlimited fine, or both.

          <p>
            Failure to complete this form with proper care may result in a loss of
            protection under the Land Registration Act 2002 if, as a result, a
            mistake is made in the register.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under section 66 of the Land Registration Act 2002 most documents
            (including this form) kept by the registrar relating to an application
            to the registrar or referred to in the register are open to public
            inspection and copying. If you believe a document contains prejudicial
            information, you may apply for that part of the document to be made
            exempt using Form EX1, under rule 136 of the Land Registration Rules 2003.

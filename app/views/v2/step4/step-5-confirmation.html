				A confirmation email has been sent to <b>peter.smith@gmail.com</b>,

			<p>
				When everyone has signed the deed:
			</p>
			<ul class="list-bullet">
				<li>
					your conveyancer will attach any required supporting documents and
					submit the mortgage to the Land Registry
				</li>
				<li>
					the Land Registry will then update your title deeds to reflect the
					change
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The time this takes will vary depending on the complexity of the
				transaction, and your lender or conveyancer will contact you if there
				are any delays.
